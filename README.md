# spotify-playlist-merge

This Webapp allows you to merge multiple playlists into one new or existing playlist. 
You will have the choice to either delete all the songs of the existing playlist and just merge the new ones into it or delete all songs and merge every new song into the playlist.
This allows you to have seperate playlists that are sorted by genres or similar and one playlist where all your sorted playlists are in to have a good mixture of your loved songs.
